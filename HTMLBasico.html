    <h1>HTML basics</h1>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its
        content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted
        points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic

    <h5>So what is HTML?</h5>

    <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series
of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to
somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For
example, take the following line of content:</p>
    
<h5>My cat is very grumpy</h5>
<p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
    paragraph tags:
<p>&lt;p>My cat is very grumpy /p>&gt;</p>
