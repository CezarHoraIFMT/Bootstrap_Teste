    <h4>So what is HTML?</h4>

    <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series
of <u>elements</u>, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing <u>tags</u> can make a word or image hyperlink to
somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For
example, take the following line of content:</p>
    
<h6>My cat is very grumpy</h6>

<p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
    paragraph tags:</p>

    <pre>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
